This repository contains the code for the project course I did at DTU focused about equivariant diffusion models for molecule generation.

Due to storage constraints, the logs from the model training and all the experiments are available in [this google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I0oNhf8u3aKamNVhfoysRMvWpZix3Pg2?usp=sharing). \
The data folder is also available in the google drive folder or can be reproduced by running  the ``process_QM9.py`` script. \
The google drive folder will be available until 01/03/2026.

Once downloaded the logs and created the data folder the root directory should look like: 
* `configs/`: YAML files for geodesics and encoding comparisons
* `data/`: Dataset for training models and dataset infos
* `scripts/`: All scripts for training and geodesics
* `logs/`: Model states and experiment results
